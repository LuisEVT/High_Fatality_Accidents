They have asked for your assistance with answering a number of questions.

### Task

 - Are there any patterns in the time of day/ day of the week when major incidents occur?
 - What characteristics stand out in major incidents compared with other accidents?
 - On what areas would you recommend the planning team focus their brainstorming efforts to reduce major incidents?
